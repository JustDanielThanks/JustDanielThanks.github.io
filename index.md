### CPSC 120

* Lab 11

    My favorite lab, hands down, was lab 11, part 1, although part 2 was also enjoyable. It was the first lab that I struggled with in a meaningful way, and the first I could not complete in class. As a result, it was the one from which I feel like I improved the most. Before lab 11, the setup and usage of classes had been confusing to me, but after seeing some examples of them used and getting hands-on work troubleshooting with them myself I became more comfortable with them. For example, accessor functions had been confusing to me, because I kept overthinking and assuming the solution could not be as simple as it was, but eventually, working through the bugs helped demystify the subject for me.

* Lab 10

    My second favorite lab would probably be lab 10, part 2. I enjoyed that activity because it has been a while since I have written code to loop through vectors of vectors, and last time I did it I was working in Python. I have always been interested in game design, and the ability to represent a two-dimensional space in code is integral to many types of games. I was already familiar with the logic behind two-dimensional vector looping, but the refresher was helpful, as was learning the syntax for it in C++.


* Lab 6

    My third favorite was lab 6, part 1, taking a sandwich order from command-line arguments. Prior to this lab, I had no experience with taking command-line arguments and using them in a program, and while some of the code for doing so was pre-written, I still got the opportunity to study it and write code around it for the first time. It let me add a useful new tool to my skill set, and it gave me an excuse to talk about my favorite food once my partner and I finished the lab work.
